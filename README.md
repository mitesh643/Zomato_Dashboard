In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of Zomato’s sales and user data using Power BI. The objective was to identify key trends in sales, customer demographics, and city-wise performance. By leveraging interactive dashboards, I visualized essential metrics such as order quantities, sales value, active users, customer retention, and city-wise contributions. This analysis helps Zomato optimize its business strategies, improve customer retention, and enhance operational efficiency.
